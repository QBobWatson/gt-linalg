        <p>
          This chapter is devoted to the algebraic study of systems of linear equations and their solutions.  We will learn a systematic way of solving equations of the form

          In <xref ref="systems-of-eqns"/>, we will introduce <em>systems of linear equations</em>, the class of equations whose study forms the subject of linear algebra.  In <xref ref="row-reduction"/>, will present a procedure, called <em>row reduction</em>, for finding all solutions of a system of linear equations.  In <xref ref="parametric-form"/>, you will see how to express all solutions of a system of linear equations in a unique way using the <em>parametric form</em> of the general solution.

      <title>Systems of Linear Equations: Geometry</title>

      <introduction>
        <note type-name="Primary Goals">
          <p>We have already discussed systems of linear equations and how this is related to matrices.  In this chapter we will learn how to write a system of linear equations succinctly as a matrix equation, which looks like <m>Ax=b</m>, where <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix, <m>b</m> is a vector in <m>\R^m</m> and <m>x</m> is a variable vector in <m>\R^n</m>.  As we will see, this is a powerful perspective.  We will study two related questions:
            <ol>
              <li>What is the set of solutions to <m>Ax=b</m>?</li>
              <li>What is the set of <m>b</m> so that <m>Ax=b</m> is consistent?</li>
            </ol>
	The first question is the kind you are used to from your first algebra class: what is the set of solutions to <m>x^2-1=0</m>.  The second is also something you could have studied in your previous algebra classes: for which <m>b</m> does <m>x^2=b</m> have a solution?  This question is more subtle at first glance, but you can solve it in the same way as the first question, with the quadratic formula.
          </p>
        </note>

        <p>
          In order to answer the two questions listed above, we will use geometry.  This will be analogous to how you used parabolas in order to understand the solutions to a quadratic equation in one variable.  Specifically, this chapter is devoted to the geometric study of two objects:
          <ol>
            <li>the solution set of a matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m>, and</li>
            <li>the set of all <m>b</m> that makes a particular system consistent.</li>
          </ol>
          The second object will be called the column space of <m>A</m>.  The two objects are related in a beautiful way by the rank theorem in <xref ref="rank-thm"/>.
        </p>

	<p>
	Instead of parabolas and hyperbolas, our geometric objects are subspaces, such as lines and planes.  Our geometric objects will be something like 13-dimensional planes in <m>\R^{27}</m>, etc.  It is amazing that we can say anything substantive about objects that we cannot directly visualize.  
	</p>

        <p>
          We will develop a large amount of vocabulary that we will use to describe the above objects: vectors (<xref ref="vectors"/>), spans (<xref ref="spans"/>), linear independence (<xref ref="linear-independence"/>), subspaces (<xref ref="subspaces"/>), dimension (<xref ref="dimension"/>),
<restrict-version versions="1554 default">
  coordinate systems (<xref ref="bases-as-coord-systems"/>),
</restrict-version>
          etc.  We will use these concepts to give a precise geometric description of the solution set of any system of equations (<xref ref="solution-sets"/>).  We will also learn how to express systems of equations more simply using matrix equations (<xref ref="matrix-equations"/>).

          In practice, one is often lead to ask questions about the geometry of a <em>transformation</em>: a function that takes an input and produces an output.  This kind of question can be answered by linear algebra if the transformation can be expressed by a matrix.

            Unfortunately, this kind of function does not come from a matrix, so one cannot use linear algebra to answer questions about this function.  In fact, these functions are rather complicated; their study is the subject of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics">inverse kinematics</url>.

          In this chapter, we will be concerned with the relationship between matrices and transformations.  In <xref ref="matrix-transformations"/>, we will consider the equation <m>b = Ax</m> as a function with independent variable <m>x</m> and dependent variable <m>b</m>, and we draw pictures accordingly.  We spend some time studying transformations in the abstract, and asking questions about a transformation, like whether it is one-to-one and/or onto (<xref ref="one-to-one-onto"/>).  In <xref ref="linear-transformations"/> we will answer the question: <q>when exactly can a transformation be expressed by a matrix?</q>  We then present matrix multiplication as a special case of composition of transformations (<xref ref="matrix-multiplication"/>).  This leads to the study of <em>matrix algebra</em>: that is, to what extent one can do arithmetic with matrices in the place of numbers.  With this in place, we learn to solve matrix equations by <em>dividing</em> by a matrix in <xref ref="matrix-inverses"/>.

          We begin by recalling the overall structure of this book:
          <ol>
            <li>Solve the matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m>.</li>
            <li>Solve the matrix equation <m>Ax=\lambda x</m>, where <m>\lambda</m> is a number.</li>

          </ol>

            Learn about determinants: their computation and their properties.
          </p>
        </note>

        <p>
          The <em>determinant</em> of a square matrix <m>A</m> is a number <m>\det(A)</m>.  This incredible quantity is one of the most important invariants of a matrix; as such, it forms the basis of most advanced computations involving matrices.
        </p>

        <p>
          In <xref ref="determinants-definitions-properties"/>, we will define the determinant in terms of its behavior with respect to row operations.  The determinant satisfies many wonderful properties: for instance, <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m> if and only if <m>A</m> is invertible.  We will discuss some of these properties in <xref ref="determinants-definitions-properties"/> as well.
          In <xref ref="determinants-cofactors"/>, we will give a recursive formula for the determinant of a matrix.  This formula is very useful, for instance, when taking the determinant of a matrix with unknown entries; this will be important in <xref ref="chap-eigenvalues"/>.
          Finally, in <xref ref="determinants-volumes"/>, we will relate determinants to volumes.  This gives a geometric interpretation for determinants, and explains why the determinant is defined the way it is.  This interpretation of determinants is a crucial ingredient in the change-of-variables formula in multivariable calculus.

          Finding approximate solutions of equations generally requires computing the closest vector on a subspace to a given vector.  This becomes an <em>orthogonality</em> problem: one needs to know which vectors are perpendicular to the subspace.
