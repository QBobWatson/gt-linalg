  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we discuss two of the most basic questions one can ask about a transformation: whether it is <em>one-to-one</em> and/or <em>onto.</em>  For a matrix transformation, we translate these questions into the language of matrices.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A transformation <m>T\colon\R^n\to\R^m</m> is <term>one-to-one</term> if, for every vector <m>b</m> in <m>\R^m</m>, the equation <m>T(x)=b</m> has <em>at most one</em> solution <m>x</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.

      Another word for <em>one-to-one</em> is <em>injective</em>.

    Here are some equivalent ways of saying that <m>T</m> is one-to-one:
    <ul>
      <li>
        For every vector <m>b</m> in <m>\R^m</m>, the equation <m>T(x) = b</m> has <em>zero or one</em> solution <m>x</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Different inputs of <m>T</m> have different outputs.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <m>T(u) = T(v)</m> then <m>u=v</m>.

  <example>
    <title>Functions of one variable</title>
    <idx><h>One-to-one</h><h>functions of one variable</h></idx>
    <p>
      The function <m>\sin\colon\R\to\R</m> is not one-to-one.  Indeed, <m>\sin(0) = \sin(\pi) = 0</m>, so the inputs <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m> have the same output <m>0</m>.  In fact, the equation <m>\sin(x) = 0</m> has infinitely many solutions <m>\ldots,-2\pi,-\pi,0,\pi,2\pi,\ldots</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <m>\exp\colon\R\to\R</m> defined by <m>\exp(x) = e^x</m> is one-to-one.  Indeed, if <m>T(x) = T(y)</m>, then <m>e^x = e^y</m>, so <m>\ln(e^x) = \ln(e^y)</m>, and hence <m>x = y</m>.  The equation <m>T(x) = C</m> has one solution <m>x = \ln(C)</m> if <m>C > 0</m>, and it has zero solutions if <m>C\leq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <m>f\colon\R\to\R</m> defined by <m>f(x)=x^3</m> is one-to-one.  Indeed, if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> then <m>x^3 = y^3</m>; taking cube roots gives <m>x = y</m>.  In other words, the only solution of <m>f(x) = C</m> is <m>x=\sqrt[3]C</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <m>f\colon\R\to\R</m> defined by <m>f(x)=x^3-x</m> is not one-to-one.   Indeed, <m>f(0) = f(1) = f(-1) = 0</m>, so the inputs <m>0,1,-1</m> all have the same output <m>0</m>.  The solutions of the equation <m>x^3 - x = 0</m> are exactly the roots of <m>f(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)</m>, and this equation has three roots.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <m>f\colon\R\to\R</m> defined by <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is not one-to-one.  Indeed, <m>f(1) = 1 = f(-1)</m>, so the inputs <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> have the same outputs.  The function <m>g\colon\R\to\R</m> defined by <m>g(x)=|x|</m> is not one-to-one for the same reason.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, and let <m>T(x)=Ax</m> be the associated matrix transformation.  The following statements are equivalent:
        <ol>
          <li><m>T</m> is one-to-one.</li>
          <li>For every <m>b</m> in <m>\R^m</m>, the equation <m>T(x)=b</m> has at most one solution.</li>
          <li>For every <m>b</m> in <m>\R^m</m>, the equation <m>Ax=b</m> has a unique solution or is inconsistent.</li>

          <li><m>A</m> has a pivot in every column.</li>
          <li>The range of <m>T</m> has dimension <m>n</m>.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Statements 1, 2, and 3 are translations of each other.  The equivalence of 3 and 4 follows from this <xref ref="solnsets-translate-span"/>: if <m>Ax=0</m> has only one solution, then <m>Ax=b</m> has only one solution as well, or it is inconsistent.  The equivalence of 4, 5, and 6 is a consequence of this <xref ref="linindep-matrix-cols"/>, and the equivalence of 6 and 7 follows from the fact that the rank of a matrix is equal to the number of columns with pivots.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Recall that <em>equivalent</em> means that, for a given matrix, either all of the statements are true simultaneously, or they are all false.

    <solution>
      <p>
        The matrix <m>A</m> is already in reduced row echelon form.  It does not have a pivot in every column, so <m>T</m> is not one-to-one.  Therefore, we know from the <xref ref="matrix-trans-one-to-one"/> that <m>Ax=0</m> has nontrivial solutions.  If <m>v</m> is a nontrivial (i.e., nonzero) solution of <m>Av = 0</m>, then <m>T(v) = Av = 0 = A0 = T(0)</m>, so <m>0</m> and <m>v</m> are different vectors with the same output.  For instance,
        <me>T\vec{0 0 1} = \mat{1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 0}\vec{0 0 1} = 0 = T\vec{0 0 0}.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Geometrically, <m>T</m> is projection onto the <m>xy</m>-plane.  Any two vectors that lie on the same vertical line will have the same projection.  For <m>b</m> on the <m>xy</m>-plane, the solution set of <m>T(x) = b</m> is the entire vertical line containing <m>b</m>.  In particular, <m>T(x) = b</m> has <em>infinitely many</em> solutions.

If you drag <m>x</m> along the violet line, the output <m>T(x) = Ax</m> does not change.  This demonstrates that <m>T(x)=0</m> has more than one solution, so <m>T</m> is not one-to-one.</caption>

    The previous two examples illustrate the following observation.  Suppose that <m>T(x)=Ax</m> is a matrix transformation that is <em>not</em> onto.  This means that <m>\text{range}(T) = \Col(A)</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^m</m> of dimension less than <m>m</m>: perhaps it is a line in the plane, or a line in <m>3</m>-space, or a plane in <m>3</m>-space, etc.  Whatever the case, the range of <m>T</m> is <em>very small</em> compared to the codomain.  To find a vector not in the range of <m>T</m>, choose a random nonzero vector <m>b</m> in <m>\R^m</m>; you have to be extremely unlucky to choose a vector that is in the range of <m>T</m>.  Of course, to check whether a given vector <m>b</m> is in the range of <m>T</m>, you have to solve the matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m> to see whether it is consistent.

    <title>Matrix transformations that are both one-to-one and onto</title>
    <p>
      In this <xref ref="matrix-trans-matrices-functions"/>, we discussed the transformations defined by several <m>2\times 2</m> matrices, namely:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \text{Reflection:} &amp;\qquad A=\mat{-1 0; 0 1}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{Dilation:} &amp;\qquad A=\mat{1.5 0; 0 1.5}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{Identity:} &amp;\qquad A=\mat{1 0; 0 1}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{Rotation:} &amp;\qquad A=\mat{0 -1; 1 0}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{Shear:} &amp;\qquad A=\mat{1 1; 0 1}.
        </mrow>
      </md>
      In each case, the associated matrix transformation <m>T(x)=Ax</m> is both one-to-one and onto.  A <m>2\times 2</m> matrix <m>A</m> has a pivot in every row if and only if it has a pivot in every column (if and only if it has two pivots), so in this case, the transformation <m>T</m> is one-to-one if and only if it is onto.  One can see geometrically that they are onto (what is the input for a given output?), or that they are one-to-one using the fact that the columns of <m>A</m> are not collinear.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>Counterclockwise rotation by <m>90^\circ</m> is a matrix transformation.  This transformation is onto (if <m>b</m> is a vector in <m>\R^2</m>, then it is the output vector for the input vector which is <m>b</m> rotated <em>clockwise</em> by <m>90^\circ</m>), and it is one-to-one (different vectors rotate to different vectors).</caption>

  <note hide-type="true">
    <title>One-to-one is the same as onto for square matrices</title>
    <idx><h>One-to-one</h><h>square matrices</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Onto</h><h>square matrices</h></idx>
    <p>
      We observed in the previous <xref ref="one-to-one-both-11-onto"/> that a square matrix has a pivot in every row if and only if it has a pivot in every column.  Therefore, a matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to itself is one-to-one if and only if it is onto: in this case, the two notions are equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, by this <xref ref="one-to-one-wide-matrices"/> and this <xref ref="one-to-one-tall-matrices"/>, if a matrix transformation <m>T\colon\R^m\to\R^n</m> is both one-to-one and onto, then <m>m=n</m>.</p>
  </note>

  <p>
    Note that in general, a transformation <m>T</m> is both one-to-one and onto if and only if <m>T(x)=b</m> has <em>exactly one</em> solution for all <m>b</m> in <m>\R^m</m>.
