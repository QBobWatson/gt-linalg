  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> and let <m>x</m> be a vector in <m>\R^n</m>.  In this section, we will learn to compute the <em>closest vector</em> <m>x_W</m> to <m>x</m> in <m>W</m>.  The vector <m>x_W</m> is called the <em>orthogonal projection</em> of <m>x</m> onto <m>W</m>.  This is exactly what we will use to almost solve matrix equations, as discussed in the introduction to <xref ref="chap-orthogonality"/>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Orthogonal Decomposition</title>

    <p>
      We begin by fixing some notation.

    <definition type-name="Notation" xml:id="projections-closest-notn">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> and let <m>x</m> be a vector in <m>\R^n</m>.  We denote the closest vector to <m>x</m> on <m>W</m> by <m>x_W</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      To say that <m>x_W</m> is the closest vector to <m>x</m> on <m>W</m> means that the difference <m>x-x_W</m> is <em>orthogonal</em> to the vectors in <m>W</m>:
      <latex-code>
\begin{tikzpicture}[myxyz, thin border nodes]
  \coordinate (u) at (0,1,0);
  \coordinate (v) at (1.1,0,-.2);
  \coordinate (uxv) at (.2,0,1.1);
  \coordinate (x) at ($-1.1*(u)+(v)+1.5*(uxv)$);
  \begin{scope}[x=(u),y=(v),transformxy]
    \fill[seq-violet!30] (-2,-2) rectangle (2,2);
    \draw[seq-violet, help lines] (-2,-2) grid (2,2);
    \node[seq-violet] at (2.6,1) {$W$};

  \point[seq-blue, "$x_W$" {below,text=seq-blue}] (y) at ($-1.1*(u)+1*(v)$);

  \point at (0,0,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
      </latex-code>
      In other words, if <m>x_{W^\perp} = x - x_W</m>, then we have <m>x = x_W + x_{W^\perp}</m>, where <m>x_W</m> is in <m>W</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp}</m> is in <m>W^\perp</m>.  The first order of business is to prove that the closest vector always exists.

        <p>
          Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> and let <m>x</m> be a vector in <m>\R^n</m>.  Then we can write <m>x</m> uniquely as
          <me>x = x_W + x_{W^\perp}</me>
          where <m>x_W</m> is the closest vector to <m>x</m> on <m>W</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp}</m> is in <m>W^\perp</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>m = \dim(W)</m>, so <m>n-m = \dim(W^\perp)</m> by this <xref ref="orthocomp-facts-basic"/>.  Let <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m</m> be a basis for <m>W</m> and let <m>v_{m+1},v_{m+2},\ldots,v_n</m> be a basis for <m>W^\perp</m>.  We showed in the proof of this <xref ref="orthocomp-facts-basic"/> that <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m,v_{m+1},v_{m+2},\ldots,v_n\}</m> is linearly independent, so it forms a basis for <m>\R^n</m>.  Therefore, we can write
          <me>
            x = (c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_mv_m) + (c_{m+1}v_{m+1} + \cdots + c_nv_n)
            = x_W + x_{W^\perp},
          </me>
          where <m>x_W = c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_mv_m</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp} = c_{m+1}v_{m+1} + \cdots + c_nv_n</m>.  Since <m>x_{W^\perp}</m> is orthogonal to <m>W</m>, the vector <m>x_W</m> is the closest vector to <m>x</m> on <m>W</m>, so this proves that such a decomposition exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for uniqueness, suppose that
          <me>x = x_W + x_{W^\perp} = y_W + y_{W^\perp}</me>
          for <m>x_W,y_W</m> in <m>W</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp},y_{W^\perp}</m> in <m>W^\perp</m>.  Rearranging gives
          <me>x_W - y_W = y_{W^\perp} - x_{W^\perp}.</me>
          Since <m>W</m> and <m>W^\perp</m> are subspaces, the left side of the equation is in <m>W</m> and the right side is in <m>W^\perp</m>.  Therefore, <m>x_W-y_W</m> is in <m>W</m> and in <m>W^\perp</m>, so it is orthogonal to itself, which implies <m>x_W-y_W=0</m>.  Hence <m>x_W = y_W</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp} = y_{W^\perp}</m>, which proves uniqueness.

        Let <m>W</m> be the <m>xy</m>-plane in <m>\R^3</m>, so <m>W^\perp</m> is the <m>z</m>-axis.  It is easy to compute the orthogonal decomposition of a vector with respect to this <m>W</m>:
        <me>
          \begin{split}
          x \amp= \vec{1 2 3} \implies x_W = \vec{1 2 0} \quad x_{W^\perp} = \vec{0 0 3}\\
          x \amp= \vec{a b c} \implies x_W = \vec{a b 0} \quad x_{W^\perp} = \vec{0 0 c}.

        We see that the orthogonal decomposition in this case expresses a vector in terms of a <q>horizontal</q> component (in the <m>xy</m>-plane) and a <q>vertical</q> component (on the <m>z</m>-axis).

    <p>
      Now we turn to the problem of computing <m>x_W</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp}</m>.  Of course, since <m>x_{W^\perp} = x - x_W</m>, really all we need is to compute <m>x_W</m>.  The following theorem gives a method for computing the orthogonal projection onto a column space.  To compute the orthogonal projection onto a general subspace, usually it is best to rewrite the subspace as the column space of a matrix, as in this <xref ref="subspace-is-col-or-nul"/>.

          Let <m>x = x_W + x_{W^\perp}</m> be the orthogonal decomposition with respect to <m>W</m>.  By definition <m>x_W</m> lies in <m>W=\Col(A)</m> and so there is a vector <m>c</m> in <m>\R^n</m> with <m>Ac = x_W</m>.  Choose any such vector <m>c</m>.

	A^TAc = A^Tx.

This exactly means that <m>A^TAc = A^Tx</m> is consistent.  If <m>c</m> is any solution to <m>A^TAc=A^Tx</m> then by reversing the above logic, we conclude that <m>x_W = Ac</m>.

	<title>Simple proof for the formula for projection onto a line</title>
	<p>
In the special case where we are projecting a vector <m>x</m> in <m>\R^n</m> onto a line <m>L = \Span\{u\}</m>, our formula for the projection can be derived very directly and simply.  The vector <m>x_L</m> is a multiple of <m>u</m>, say <m>x_L=cu</m>.  This multiple is chosen so that <m>x-x_L=x-cu</m> is perpendicular to <m>u</m>, as in the following picture.

        <latex-code>
\begin{tikzpicture}[thin border nodes]
  \draw[seq-violet] (-3,-2) -- node[below right, very near start] {$L$} (3,2);
  \draw[vector] (0,0) --  node[below right] {$u$} (1.5,1);
  \draw[vector] (0,0) --  node[below right] {$cu$} (-15/13,-10/13);

In other words,
	<me>
	(x-cu) \cdot u = 0.
	</me>
Using the distributive property for the dot product and isolating the variable <m>c</m> gives us that
<me>
c = \frac{u\cdot x}{u\cdot u}
</me>
and so
        <me>x_L = cu = \frac{u\cdot x}{u\cdot u}\,u.</me>

        <p>
          <em>Method 1:</em> First we need to find a spanning set for <m>W</m>.  We notice that <m>W</m> is the solution set of the homogeneous equation <m>x_1 - 2x_2 - x_3 = 0</m>, so <m>W = \Nul\mat{1 -2 -1}</m>.  We know how to compute a basis for a null space: we row reduce and find the parametric vector form.  The matrix <m>\mat{1 -2 -1}</m> is already in reduced row echelon form.  The parametric form is <m>x_1 = 2x_2 + x_3</m>, so the parametric vector form is
          <me>\vec{x_1 x_2 x_3} = x_2\vec{2 1 0} + x_3\vec{1 0 1},</me>
          and hence a basis for <m>V</m> is given by
          <me>\left\{\vec{2 1 0},\;\vec{1 0 1}\right\}.</me>
          We let <m>A</m> be the matrix whose columns are our basis vectors:
          <me>A = \mat{2 1; 1 0; 0 1}.</me>
          Hence <m>\Col(A) = \Nul\mat{1 -2 -1} = W</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can continue with step 1 of the recipe.  We compute

            A^TA = \mat{5 2; 2 2} \qquad A^Tx = \vec{3 2}.
          </me>
          We write the linear system <m>A^TAc = A^Tx</m> as an augmented matrix and row reduce:

            \amat{5 2 3; 2 2 2} \rref \amat{1 0 1/3; 0 1 2/3}.
          </me>
          Hence we can take <m>c = {1/3\choose 2/3}</m>, so
          <me>
            x_W = Ac = \mat{2 1; 1 0; 0 1}\vec{1/3 2/3} = \frac 13\vec{4 1 2}.

        <p>
          <em>Method 2:</em> In this case, it is easier to compute <m>x_{W^\perp}</m>.  Indeed, since <m>W = \Nul\mat{1 -2 -1},</m> the orthogonal complement is the line
          <me>V = W^\perp = \Col\vec{1 -2 -1}.</me>
          Using the formula for <xref ref="projections-onto-line">projection onto a line</xref> gives
          <me>
            x_{W^\perp} = x_V = \frac{\vec{1 1 1}\cdot\vec{1 -2 -1}}{\vec{1 -2 -1}\cdot\vec{1 -2 -1}}\vec{1 -2 -1} = \frac 13\vec{-1 2 1}.

This function turns out to be a linear transformation with many nice properties, and is a good example of a linear transformation which is not originally defined as a matrix transformation.

          Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>, and define <m>T\colon\R^n\to\R^n</m> by <m>T(x) = x_W</m>.  Then:

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We have to verify the <xref ref="linear-trans-defn">defining properties of linearity</xref>.  Let <m>x,y</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, and let <m>x = x_W + x_{W^\perp}</m> and <m>y = y_W + y_{W^\perp}</m> be their orthogonal decompositions.  Since <m>W</m> and <m>W^\perp</m> are subspaces, the sums <m>x_W+y_W</m> and <m>x_{W^\perp}+y_{W^\perp}</m> are in <m>W</m> and <m>W^\perp</m>, respectively.  Therefore, the orthogonal decomposition of <m>x+y</m> is <m>(x_W+y_W)+(x_{W^\perp}+y_{W^\perp})</m>, so
              <me>
                T(x+y) = (x+y)_W = x_W+y_W = T(x) + T(y).
              </me>
              Now let <m>c</m> be a scalar.  Then <m>cx_W</m> is in <m>W</m> and <m>cx_{W^\perp}</m> is in <m>W^\perp</m>, so the orthogonal decomposition of <m>cx</m> is <m>cx_W + cx_{W^\perp}</m>, and therefore,
              <me>
                T(cx) = (cx)_W = cx_W = cT(x).
              </me>
              Since <m>T</m> satisfies the two <xref ref="linear-trans-defn">defining properties</xref>, it is a linear transformation.

            <li>
              For any <m>x</m> in <m>\R^n</m> the vector <m>T(x)</m> is in <m>W</m>, so <m>T\circ T(x) = T(T(x)) = T(x)</m> by 2.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any vector <m>x</m> in <m>W</m> is in the range of <m>T</m>, because <m>T(x) = x</m> for such vectors.  On the other hand, for any vector <m>x</m> in <m>\R^n</m> the output <m>T(x) = x_W</m> is in <m>W</m>, so <m>W</m> is the range of <m>T</m>.

      We compute the standard matrix of the orthogonal projection in the same way as for <xref ref="matrix-of-transformation" text="title">any other transformation</xref>: by evaluating on the standard coordinate vectors.  In this case, this means projecting the standard coordinate vectors onto the subspace.

        <p>
          The columns of <m>B</m> are <m>T(e_1) = (e_1)_W</m>, <m>T(e_2) = (e_2)_W</m>, and <m>T(e_3) = (e_3)_W</m>.  Let

          To compute each <m>(e_i)_W</m>, we solve the matrix equation <m>A^TAc = A^Te_i</m> for <m>c</m>, then use the equality <m>(e_i)_W = Ac</m>.  First we note that

            A^TA = \mat{2 1; 1 2};
            \qquad
            A^Te_i = \text{the $i$th column of } A^T = \mat{1 0 -1; 1 1 0}.
          </me>
          For <m>e_1</m>, we form an augmented matrix and row reduce:

            \amat{2 1 1; 1 2 1} \rref

            \amat{2 1 -1; 1 2 0} \rref

      <proof>
        <p>
          The first four assertions are translations of <xref ref="projections-properties-of">properties 5, 3, 4, and 2</xref>, respectively, using this <xref ref="matrix-trans-dictionary"/> and this <xref ref="matrix-mult-comp-is-prod"/>.  The fifth assertion is equivalent to the second, by this <xref ref="evecs-eval0"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the final assertion, we showed in the proof of this <xref ref="projections-decomp-exists"/> that there is a basis of <m>\R^n</m> of the form <m>\{v_1,\ldots,v_m,v_{m+1},\ldots,v_n\}</m>, where <m>\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}</m> is a basis for <m>W</m> and <m>\{v_{m+1},\ldots,v_n\}</m> is a basis for <m>W^\perp</m>.  Each <m>v_i</m> is an eigenvector of <m>B</m>: indeed, for <m>i\leq m</m> we have
          <me>
            Bv_i = T(v_i) = v_i = 1\cdot v_i
          </me>
          because <m>v_i</m> is in <m>W</m>, and for <m>i > m</m> we have
          <me>
            Bv_i = T(v_i) = 0 = 0\cdot v_i
          </me>
          because <m>v_i</m> is in <m>W^\perp</m>.  Therefore, we have found a basis of eigenvectors, with associated eigenvalues <m>1,\ldots,1,0,\ldots,0</m> (<m>m</m> ones and <m>n-m</m> zeros).  Now we use the <xref ref="diagonalization-thm"/>.

      </proof>
    </proposition>

<p>We emphasize that the <xref ref="projections-matrices-properties-of">properties of projection matrices</xref> would be very hard to prove in terms of matrices.  By translating all of the statements into statements about linear transformations, they become much more transparent.  For example, consider the projection matrix we found in this <xref ref="projections-onto-plane3"/>.  Just by looking at the matrix it is not at all obvious that when you square the matrix you get the same matrix back.</p>

    <example xml:id="projections-onto-plane4">
      <p>
        Continuing with the above <xref ref="projections-onto-plane3"/>, we showed that

          B = \frac 13\mat{2 1 -1; 1 2 1; -1 1 2}
        </me>
        is the standard matrix of the orthogonal projection onto
        <me>
          W = \Span\left\{\vec{1 0 -1},\;\vec{1 1 0}\right\}.
        </me>
        One can verify by hand that <m>B^2=B</m> (try it!).  We compute <m>W^\perp</m> as the null space of
        <me>
          \mat{1 0 -1; 1 1 0} \rref \mat{1 0 -1; 0 1 1}.
        </me>
        The free variable is <m>x_3</m>, and the parametric form is <m>x_1 = x_3,\,x_2 = -x_3</m>, so that
        <me>
          W^\perp = \Span\left\{\vec{1 -1 1}\right\}.
        </me>
        It follows that <m>B</m> has eigenvectors
        <me>
          \vec{1 0 -1},\qquad \vec{1 1 0},\qquad \vec{1 -1 1}
        </me>
        with eigenvalues <m>1,1,0</m>, respectively, so that
        <me>
          B = \mat{1 1 1; 0 1 -1; -1 0 1}\mat{1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 0}\mat{1 1 1; 0 1 -1; -1 0 1}\inv.

    <remark>
      <p>
        As we saw in this <xref ref="projections-onto-plane4"/>, if you are willing to compute bases for <m>W</m> and <m>W^\perp</m>, then this provides a third way of finding the standard matrix <m>B</m> for projection onto <m>W</m>: indeed, if <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m\}</m> is a basis for <m>W</m> and <m>\{v_{m+1},v_{m+2},\ldots,v_n\}</m> is a basis for <m>W^\perp</m>, then
        <me>
          B = \mat{| | ,, |; v_1 v_1 \cdots, v_n; | | ,, |}
          \mat{
          1 \cdots, 0 0 \cdots, 0;
          \vdots, \ddots, \vdots, \vdots, \ddots, \vdots;
          0 \cdots, 1 0 \cdots, 0;
          0 \cdots, 0 0 \cdots, 0;
          \vdots, \ddots, \vdots, \vdots, \ddots, \vdots;
          0 \cdots, 0 0 \cdots, 0}
          \mat{| | ,, |; v_1 v_1 \cdots, v_n; | | ,, |}\inv,
        </me>
        where the middle matrix in the product is the diagonal matrix with <m>m</m> ones and <m>n-m</m> zeros on the diagonal.  However, since you already have a basis for <m>W</m>, it is faster to multiply out the expression <m>A(A^TA)\inv A^T</m> as in the <xref ref="projections-ATA-formula2"/>.

        Since <m>x_{W^\perp} = x - x_W</m>, we also have
        <me>
          \refl_W(x) = x - 2(x - x_W) = 2x_W - x.
        </me>
        We leave it to the reader to check using the definition that:
        <ol>
          <li><m>\refl_W\circ\refl_W = \Id_{\R^n}.</m></li>
          <li>The <m>1</m>-eigenspace of <m>\refl_W</m> is <m>W</m>, and the <m>-1</m>-eigenspace of <m>\refl_W</m> is <m>W^\perp</m>.</li>
          <li><m>\refl_W</m> is similar to the diagonal matrix with <m>m = \dim(W)</m> ones on the diagonal and <m>n-m</m> negative ones.</li>
        </ol>
