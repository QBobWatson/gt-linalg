  <introduction>
    <p>
      Sometimes the span of a set of vectors is <q>smaller</q> than you expect from the
number of vectors, as in the picture below.  This means that (at least) one of the vectors is redundant: it can be removed without affecting the span.  In the present section, we formalize this idea in the notion of <em>linear independence</em>.

        <p>
          A set of vectors <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is <term>linearly independent</term> if the vector equation
          <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_kv_k = 0</me>
          has only the trivial solution <m>x_1=x_2=\cdots=x_k=0</m>.  The set <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is <term>linearly dependent</term> otherwise.

      <idx><h>Linear dependence relation</h><see>Linear independence</see></idx>
      In other words, <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is linearly dependent if there exist numbers <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k</m>, not all equal to zero, such that
      <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_kv_k = 0.</me>
      This is called a <term>linear dependence relation</term> or <term>equation of linear dependence</term>.
    </p>

    <bluebox>
      <p>
        Note that linear dependence and linear independence are notions that apply to a <em>collection of vectors</em>.  It does not make sense to say things like <q>this vector is linearly dependent on these other vectors,</q> or <q>this matrix is linearly independent.</q>
      </p>
    </bluebox>

    <example>
      <title>Checking linear dependence</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is the set
          <me>\left\{ \vec{1 1 1},\, \vec{1 -1 2},\, \vec{3 1 4} \right\}</me>
          linearly independent?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Equivalently, we are asking if the homogeneous vector equation
          <me>x\vec{1 1 1} + y\vec{1 -1 2} + z\vec{3 1 4} = \vec{0 0 0}</me>
          has a nontrivial solution.  We solve this by forming a matrix and row reducing (we do not augment because of this <xref ref="solnsets-no-augment"/>):
          <me>\mat{1 1 3; 1 -1 1; 1 2 4}
          \quad\xrightarrow{\text{row reduce}}\quad
          \mat{1 0 2; 0 1 1; 0 0 0}</me>
          This says <m>x = -2z</m> and <m>y = -z</m>.  So there exist nontrivial solutions: for instance, taking <m>z=1</m> gives this equation of linear dependence:
          <me>-2\vec{1 1 1} - \vec{1 -1 2} + \vec{3 1 4} = \vec{0 0 0}.</me>

    <example xml:id="param-vect-form-lin-ind">
      <title>Vector parametric form</title>
      <p>An important observation is that the vectors coming from the parametric vector form of the solution of a matrix equation <m>Ax=0</m> are linearly independent.  In this <xref ref="solnsets-eg-plane"/> we saw that the solution set of <m>Ax=0</m> for 
        <me>A = \mat{1 -1 2; -2 2 -4}?</me>
is
        <me>x = \vec{x_1 x_2 x_3} = x_2\vec{1 1 0} + x_3\vec{-2 0 1}.</me>
Let's explain why the vectors <m>(1,1,0)</m> and <m>(-2,0,1)</m> are linearly independent.  Suppose that
<me>\vec{0 0 0} = x_2\vec{1 1 0} + x_3\vec{-2 0 1} = \vec{x_2-2x_3 x_2 x_3}.</me>
          Comparing the second and third coordinates, we see that <m>x_2=x_3=0</m>.  This reasoning will work in any example, since the entries corresponding to the free variables are all equal to 1 or 0, and are only equal to 1 in one of the vectors.  This observation forms part of this <xref ref="dimension-basis-nulspace"/>.

    <p>
      The above examples lead to the following recipe.

    <bluebox xml:id="linindep-matrix-cols">
      <title>Recipe: Checking linear independence</title>
      <idx><h>Linear Independence</h><h>verifying</h></idx>
    <p>
      A set of vectors <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is linearly independent if and only if the vector equation
      <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_kv_k = 0</me>
      has only the trivial solution, if and only if the matrix equation
      <m>Ax=0</m>
      has only the trivial solution, where <m>A</m> is the matrix with columns <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m>:
      <me>A = \mat{| |, , |; v_1 v_2 \cdots, v_k; | |, , |}.</me>
      This is true if and only if <m>A</m> has a <xref ref="defn-pivot-pos" text="title">pivot position</xref> in every column.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving the matrix equatiion <m>Ax=0</m> will either verify that the columns <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> are linearly independent, or will produce a linear dependence relation by substituting any nonzero values for the free variables.
    </p>
    </bluebox>

    <p>
      (Recall that <m>Ax=0</m> has a nontrivial solution if and only if <m>A</m> has a column without a pivot: see this <xref ref="solnsets-nontrivial"/>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that <m>A</m> has more columns than rows.  Then <m>A</m> cannot have a pivot in every column (it has at most one pivot per row), so its columns are automatically linearly dependent.
    </p>

    <bluebox xml:id="linindep-wide-matrix">
      <idx><h>Linear Independence</h><h>wide matrices</h></idx>
      <p>A wide matrix (a matrix with more columns than rows) has linearly dependent columns.</p>

      <p>For example, four vectors in <m>\R^3</m> are automatically linearly dependent.  Note that a tall matrix may or may not have linearly independent columns.</p>

          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If <m>v_1 = cv_2</m> then <m>v_1-cv_2=0</m>, so <m>\{v_1,v_2\}</m> is linearly dependent.  In the other direction, if <m>x_1v_1+x_2v_2=0</m> with <m>x_1\neq0</m> (say), then <m>v_1 = -\frac{x_2}{x_1}v_2</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is easy to produce a linear dependence relation if one vector is the zero vector: for instance, if <m>v_1=0</m> then
              <me>1\cdot v_1 + 0\cdot v_2 + \cdots + 0\cdot v_k = 0.</me>
            </li>
            <li>
              After reordering, we may suppose that <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_r\}</m> is linearly dependent, with <m>r &lt; p</m>.  This means that there is an equation of linear dependence
              <me>x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_rv_r = 0</me>,
              with at least one of <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_r</m> nonzero.  This is also an equation of linear dependence among <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m>, since we can take the coefficients of <m>v_{r+1},\ldots,v_k</m> to all be zero.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </fact>

    <p>
      With regard to the first fact, note that the zero vector is a multiple of any vector, so it is collinear with any other vector.  Hence facts 1 and 2 are consistent with each other.

  <subsection>
    <title>Criteria for Linear Independence</title>

    <p>
      In this subsection we give two criteria for a set of vectors to be linearly independent.  Keep in mind, however, that the actual <xref ref="linindep-defn-linindep"/> is above.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="linindep-criterion-inspan">
      <statement>
        <p>A set of vectors <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors is in the span of the other ones.</p>
        <p>Any such vector may be removed without affecting the span.</p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose, for instance, that <m>v_3</m> is in <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,v_4\}</m>, so we have an equation like
          <me>v_3 = 2v_1 - \frac 12v_2 + 6v_4.</me>
          We can subract <m>v_3</m> from both sides of the equation to get
          <me>0 = 2v_1 - \frac 12v_2 - v_3 + 6v_4.</me>
          This is a linear dependence relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, any linear combination of <m>v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4</m> is already a linear combination of <m>v_1,v_2,v_4</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>
              x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + x_3v_3 + x_4v_4 &amp;=
              x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + x_3\left(2v_1-\frac 12v_2 + 6v_4\right) + x_4v_4
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;= (x_1+2x_3)v_1 + \left(x_2-\frac 12x_3\right)v_2 + (x_4+6)v_4.
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Therefore, <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}</m> is contained in <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,v_4\}</m>.  Any linear combination of <m>v_1,v_2,v_4</m> is also a linear combination of <m>v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4</m> (with the <m>v_3</m>-coefficient equal to zero), so <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,v_4\}</m> is also contained in <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}</m>, and thus they are equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the other direction, if we have a linear dependence relation like
          <me>0 = 2v_1 - \frac 12v_2 + v_3 - 6v_4,</me>
          then we can move any nonzero term to the left side of the equation and divide by its coefficient:
          <me>v_1 = \frac 12\left(\frac 12v_2 - v_3 + 6v_4\right).</me>
          This shows that <m>v_1</m> is in <m>\Span\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We leave it to the reader to generalize this proof for any set of vectors.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <bluebox type-name="Warning" hide-type="false" xml:id="linindep-not-any"><p>
      In a linearly dependent set <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m>, it is not generally true that <em>any</em> vector <m>v_j</m> is in the span of the others, only that <em>at least one</em> of them is.
    </p></bluebox>

    <p>
      For example, the set <m>\bigl\{{1\choose 0},\,{2\choose 0},\,{0\choose 1}\bigr\}</m> is linearly dependent, but <m>{0\choose 1}</m> is not in the span of the other two vectors.  Also see this <xref ref="linindep-3d-4vecs"/> below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The previous <xref ref="linindep-criterion-inspan"/> makes precise in what sense a set of linearly dependent vectors is redundant.
    </p>

      <title>Increasing Span Criterion</title>
      <idx><h>Linear Independence</h><h>increasing span criterion</h></idx>
      <idx><h>Increasing span criterion</h><see>Linear independence</see></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>A set of vectors <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is linearly independent if and only if, for every <m>j</m>, the vector <m>v_j</m> is not in <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{j-1}\}</m>.</p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It is equivalent to show that <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is linearly dependent if and only if <m>v_j</m> is in <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{j-1}\}</m> for some <m>j</m>.  The <q>if</q> implication is an immediate consequence of the previous <xref ref="linindep-criterion-inspan"/>.  Suppose then that <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is linearly dependent.  This means that some <m>v_j</m> is in the span of the others.  Choose the largest such <m>j</m>.  We claim that this <m>v_j</m> is in <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{j-1}\}</m>.  If not, then
          <me>v_j = x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_{j-1}v_{j-1} + x_{j+1}v_{j+1} + \cdots + x_kv_k</me>
          with not all of <m>x_{j+1},\ldots,x_k</m> equal to zero.  Suppose for simplicity that <m>x_k\neq 0</m>.  Then we can rearrange:
          <me>
            v_k = -\frac 1{x_k}\bigl( x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \cdots + x_{j-1}v_{j-1}
            - v_j + x_{j+1}v_{j+1} + \cdots + x_{p-1}v_{p-1}
            \bigr).
          </me>
          This says that <m>v_k</m> is in the span of <m>\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{p-1}\}</m>, which contradicts our assumption that <m>v_j</m> is the last vector in the span of the others.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      We can rephrase this as follows:
    </p>

    <bluebox>
      <p>If you make a set of vectors by adding one vector at a time, and if the span got bigger every time you added a vector, then your set is linearly independent.</p>

    The set of three vectors <m>\{v,w,u\}</m> below is linearly dependent:

  <subsection>
    <title>Linear Dependence and Free Variables</title>

    <p>
      In light of this <xref ref="linindep-matrix-cols"/> and this <xref ref="linindep-criterion-inspan">criterion</xref>, it is natural to ask which columns of a matrix are redundant, i.e., which we can remove without affecting the column span.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="linindep-pivot-cols">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, and consider the matrix
          <me>A = \mat{| |, , |; v_1 v_2 \cdots, v_k; | |, , |}.</me>
          Then we can delete the columns of <m>A</m> <em>without</em> pivots (the columns corresponding to the free variables), without changing <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>The pivot columns are linearly independent, so we cannot delete any more columns without changing the span.</p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          If the matrix is in reduced row echelon form:
          <me>A = \mat{1 0 2 0; 0 1 3 0; 0 0 0 1}</me>
          then the column without a pivot is visibly in the span of the pivot columns:
          <me>\vec{2 3 0} = 2\vec{1 0 0} + 3\vec{0 1 0} + 0\vec{0 0 1},</me>
          and the pivot columns are linearly independent:
          <me>
            \vec{0 0 0} = x_1\vec{1 0 0} + x_2\vec{0 1 0} + x_4\vec{0 0 1}
            = \vec{x_1 x_2 x_4} \implies x_1 = x_2 = x_4 = 0.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          If the matrix is not in reduced row echelon form, then we row reduce:
          <me>
            A = \mat{1 7 23 3; 2 4 16 0; -1 -2 -8 4}
            \quad\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\quad\mat{1 0 2 0; 0 1 3 0; 0 0 0 1}.
          </me>
          The following two vector equations have the same solution set, as they come from row-equivalent matrices:
          <me>
            \spalignsysdelims..\syseq{
            x_1\vec{1 2 -1} + x_2\vec{7 4 -2} + x_3\vec{23 16 -8} + x_4\vec{3 0 4} = 0;
            x_1\vec{1 0  0} + x_2\vec{0 1  0} + x_3\vec{ 2  3  0} + x_4\vec{0 0 1}

          We conclude that
          <me>\vec{23 16 -8} = 2\vec{1 2 -1} + 3\vec{7 4 -2} + 0\vec{3 0 4}</me>
          and that
          <me>x_1\vec{1 2 -1} + x_2\vec{7 4 -2} + x_4\vec{3 0 4} = 0</me>
          has only the trivial solution.

      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Note that it is necessary to row reduce <m>A</m> to find which are its <xref ref="defn-pivot-pos" text="title">pivot columns</xref>.  However, the span of the columns of the row reduced matrix is generally <em>not</em> equal to the span of the columns of <m>A</m>: one must use the pivot columns of the <em>original</em> matrix.  See <xref ref="dimension-basis-colspace"/> for a restatement of the above theorem.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        The matrix
        <me>A = \mat[r]{1 2 0 -1; -2 -3 4 5; 2 4 0 -2}</me>
        has reduced row echelon form
        <me>\mat[r]{1 0 -8 -7; 0 1 4 3; 0 0 0 0}.</me>
        Therefore, the first two columns of <m>A</m> are the pivot columns, so we can delete the others without changing the span:
        <me>
          \Span\left\{\vec{1 -2 2},\;\vec{2 -3 4}\right\}
          = \Span\left\{\vec{1 -2 2},\;\vec{2 -3 4},\;\vec{0 4 0},\;\vec{-1 5 -2}\right\}.
        </me>
        Moreover, the first two columns are linearly independent.
      </p>
    </example>

    <bluebox xml:id="pivot-cols-dim">
      <title>Pivot Columns and Dimension</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>d</m> be the number of pivot columns in the matrix
        <me>A = \mat{| |, , |; v_1 v_2 \cdots, v_k; | |, , |}.</me>
        <ul>
          <li>If <m>d=1</m> then <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is a line.</li>
          <li>If <m>d=2</m> then <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is a plane.</li>
          <li>If <m>d=3</m> then <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k\}</m> is a 3-space.</li>
          <li>Et cetera.</li>
        </ul>
	The number <m>d</m> is called the dimension.  We discussed this notion in this <xref ref="soln-sets-dim-hom"/> and this <xref ref="soln-sets-dim-inhom"/>.  We will define this concept rigorously in <xref ref="dimension"/>.

            T = \bigl\{2v_1+3v_2+v_3,\, v_1-v_2+2v_3,\, 2v_1+v_2-v_3\bigr\}
          </me>
          is linearly independent.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="solution-li-31">
        <p>
          According to Definition <xref provisional="defn-?" />, we need show that if <m>a_1,a_2,a_3</m> are any scalars satisfying
          <me>
            a_1\bigl(2{v}_1+3{v}_2+{v}_3\bigr) +
            a_2\bigl({v}_1-{v}_2+2{v}_3\bigr) +
            a_3\bigl(2{v}_1+{v}_2-{v}_3\bigr) = 0,
          </me>
          then necessarily <m>a_1=a_2=a_3=0</m>.
          We can rearrange this vector equation to
          <me>
            \bigl(2a_1+a_2+2a_3\bigr){v}_1+
                    \bigl(3a_1-a_2+a_3\bigr){v}_2+
                    \bigl(a_1+2a_2-a_3\bigr){v}_3
                    = 0.
          </me>
          Because the set <m>S=\setof{v,v_2,v_3}</m> was assumed to be linearly independent, by <xref provisional="definition-?"/> we <em>must</em> conclude that
          <me>
            \syseq{2a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 0;
                   3a_1 - a_2 + a_3 = 0;
                   a_1 + 2a_2 - a_3 = 0\rlap.}
          </me>
          By the familiar methods, you can check that this homogeneous system of linear equations admits only the trivial solution <m>a_1=a_2=a_3=0</m>, as desired.
        </p>

        <p>Compare this solution very carefully with <xref ref="exercise-li-30" text="type-global"/>, noting especially how this problem required (and used) the hypothesis that the original set be linearly independent, and how this solution feels more like a proof, while the previous problem could be solved with a fairly simple demonstration of any nontrivial relation of linear dependence.</p>
