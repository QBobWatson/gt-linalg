      <solution>
        <p>We form an augmented matrix and row reduce:

      <p>When we row reduce the augmented matrix for a homogeneous system of linear equations, the last column will be zero throughout the row reduction process.  We saw this in the last <xref ref="solnsets-eg-no-nontrivial"/>:
      <me>\amat{1 3 4 0; 2 -1 2 0; 1 0 1 0}</me>
      So it is not really necessary to write augmented matrices when solving homogeneous systems.</p>

    <p>
      When the homogeneous equation <m>Ax=0</m> does have nontrivial solutions, it turns out that the solution set can be conveniently expressed as a span.

      <title>Parametric Vector Form (homogeneous case)</title>
      <idx><h>Parametric vector form</h><h>of a homogeneous equation</h></idx>
      <p>
        Consider the following matrix in reduced row echelon form:
        <me>A = \mat{1 0 -8 -7; 0 1 4 3; 0 0 0 0}.</me>
        The matrix equation <m>Ax=0</m> corresponds to the system of equations
        <me>
          \syseq{x_1 \+ \. - 8x_3 - 7x_4 = 0;
          \. \+ x_2 + 4x_3 + 3x_4 = 0\rlap.}
        </me>
        We can write the parametric form as follows:
        <me>\syseq{
        x_1 = 8x_3 + 7x_4;
        x_2 = -4x_3 - 3x_4;
        x_3 = x_3;
        x_4 = \. \+ x_4\rlap.}
        </me>
        We wrote the redundant equations <m>x_3=x_3</m> and <m>x_4=x_4</m> in order to turn the above system into a <em>vector equation</em>:
        <me>x = \vec{x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4} = x_3\vec{8 -4 1 0} + x_4\vec{7 -3 0 1}.</me>
        This vector equation is called the <term>parametric vector form</term> of the solution set.
        Since <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> are allowed to be anything, this says that the solution set is the set of all linear combinations of <m>\vec{8 -4 1 0}</m> and <m>\vec{7 -3 0 1}</m>.  In other words, the solution set is
        <me>\Span\left\{\vec{8 -4 1 0},\;\vec{7 -3 0 1}\right\}.</me>
      </p>
    </specialcase>

    <p>Here is the general procedure.</p>

    <bluebox>
      <title>Recipe: Parametric vector form (homogeneous case)</title>
      <idx><h>Parametric vector form</h><h>of a homogeneous equation</h></idx>
      <idx><h>System of linear equations</h><h>parametric vector form of</h><see>Parametric vector form</see></idx>
      <p>Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m\times n</m> matrix.  Suppose that the free variables in the homogeneous equation <m>Ax=0</m> are, for example, <m>x_3</m>, <m>x_6</m>, and <m>x_8</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>Find the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>.</li>
        <li>Write the parametric form of the solution set, including the redundant equations <m>x_3=x_3</m>, <m>x_6=x_6</m>, <m>x_8=x_8</m>.  Put equations for all of the <m>x_i</m> in order.</li>
        <li>Make a single vector equation from these equations by making the coefficients of <m>x_3,x_6,</m> and <m>x_8</m> into vectors <m>v_3,v_6,</m> and <m>v_8</m>, respectively.</li>
      </ol>
      The solutions to <m>Ax=0</m> will then be expressed in the form
      <me> x = x_3v_3 + x_6v_6 + x_8v_8</me>
      for some vectors <m>v_3,v_6,v_8</m> in <m>\R^n</m>, and any scalars <m>x_3,x_6,x_8</m>.  This is called the <term>parametric vector form</term> of the solution.
        </p>
        <p>In this case, the solution set can be written as
        <m>\Span\{v_3,\,v_6,\,v_8\}.</m>
        </p>
    </bluebox>

    <p>
      We emphasize the following fact in particular.
    </p>

    <bluebox xml:id="solnsets-are-spans">
      <idx><h>Solution set</h><h>of a homogeneous system is a span</h></idx>
      <p>
	The set of solutions to a homogeneous equation <m>Ax=0</m> is a span.
      </p>
      </bluebox>

    <example xml:id="solnsets-eg-line">
      <title>The solution set is a line</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Compute the parametric vector form of the solution set of <m>Ax=0</m>, where
        <me>A = \mat{1 -3; 2 -6}.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>We row reduce (without augmenting, as suggested in the above <xref ref="solnsets-no-augment"/>):
        <me>\mat{1 -3; 2 -6} \quad\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\quad
        \mat{1 -3; 0 0}.
        </me>
        This corresponds to the single equation <m>x_1 - 3x_2=0</m>.  We write the parametric form including the redundant equation <m>x_2=x_2</m>:
        <me>\syseq{x_1 = 3x_2; x_2 = x_2\rlap.}</me>
        We turn these into a single vector equation:
        <me>x = \vec{x_1 x_2} = x_2\vec{3 1}.</me>
        This is the parametric vector form of the solution set.
        Since <m>x_2</m> is allowed to be anything, this says that the solution set is the set of all scalar multiples of <m>{3\choose 1}</m>, otherwise known as
        <me>\Span\left\{\vec{3 1}\right\}.</me>
        We know how to draw the picture of a span of a vector: it is a line.  Therefore, this is a picture of the the solution set:

    <p>Since there were <em>three</em> variables in the above <xref ref="solnsets-eg-plane"/>, the solution set is a subset of <m>\R^3</m>.  Since <em>two</em> of the variables were free, the solution set is a <em>plane</em>.</p>

    <p>
      There is a natural question to ask here: is it possible to write the solution to a homogeneous matrix equation using fewer vectors than the one given in the above recipe?  We will see in <xref ref="param-vect-form-lin-ind"/> that the answer is <em>no</em>: the vectors from the recipe are always linearly independent, which means that there is no way to write the solution with fewer vectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another natural question is: are the solution sets for inhomogeneuous equations also spans?  As we will see shortly, they are never spans, but they are closely related to spans.
    </p>

    <p>
    There is a natural relationship between the number of free variables and the <q>size</q> of the solution set, as follows.
    </p>

    <bluebox xml:id="soln-sets-dim-hom"><title>Dimension of the solution set</title>
    <idx><h>Line</h><h>dimension-1 solution set</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Plane</h><h>dimension-2 solution set</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Space</h><h>dimension-3 solution set</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Dimension</h><h>of a solution set</h></idx>
    <p>The above examples show us the following pattern: when there is one free variable in a consistent matrix equation, the solution set is a line, and when there are two free variables, the solution set is a plane, etc.  The number of free variables is called the <em>dimension</em> of the solution set.
    </p>
    </bluebox>

<p>We will develop a rigorous definition of dimension in <xref ref="dimension"/>, but for now the dimension will simply mean the number of free variables.  Compare with this <xref ref="pivot-cols-dim"/>.</p>

    <p>Intuitively, the dimension of a solution set is the number of parameters you need to describe a point in the solution set.  For a line only one parameter is needed, and for a plane two parameters are needed.  This is similar to how the location of a building on Peachtree Street<mdash/>which is like a line<mdash/>is determined by one number and how a street corner in Manhattan<mdash/>which is like a plane<mdash/>is specified by two numbers.</p>

    <title>Inhomogeneous Systems</title>

    <p>
      Recall that a matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m> is called <term>inhomogeneous</term> when <m>b\neq0</m>.

        This corresponds to the single equation <m>x_1 - 3x_2 = -3</m>.  We can write the parametric form as follows:
        <me>\syseq{x_1 = 3x_2 - 3; x_2 = x_2 + 0\rlap.}</me>

Geometrically, this is accomplished by first drawing the span of <m>{3\choose 1}</m>, which is a line through the origin (and, not coincidentally, the solution to <m>Ax=0</m>), and we <em>translate</em>, or push, this line along <m>p = {-3\choose 0}</m>.  The translated line contains <m>p</m> and is parallel to <m>\Span\{{3\choose 1}\}</m>: it is a <em>translate of a line</em>.

        <p>We row reduce the associated augmented matrix:
        <me>\amat{1 -1 2 1; -2 2 -4 -2} \quad\xrightarrow{\text{RREF}}\quad
        \mat{1 -1 2 1; 0 0 0 0}.
        </me>
        This corresponds to the single equation <m>x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 = 1</m>.  We can write the parametric form as follows:
        <me>\syseq{x_1 = x_2 - 2x_3 + 1; x_2 = x_2 \+ \. + 0; x_3 = \. \+ x_3 + 0\rlap.}</me>
        We turn the above system into a <em>vector equation</em>:
        <me>x = \vec{x_1 x_2 x_3} = x_2\vec{1 1 0} + x_3\vec{-2 0 1} + \vec{1 0 0}.</me>
        This vector equation is called the <term>parametric vector form</term> of the solution set.
        Since <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m> are allowed to be anything, this says that the solution set is the set of all linear combinations of <m>\vec{1 1 1}</m> and <m>\vec{-2 0 1}</m>, <em>translated</em> by the vector <m>p = \vec{1 0 0}</m>.  This is a plane which contains <m>p</m> and is parallel to <m>\Span\left\{\vec{1 1 1},\;\vec{-2 0 1}\right\}</m>: it is a <em>translate of a plane</em>.  We write the solution set as
        <me>\Span\left\{\vec{1 1 1},\;\vec{-2 0 1}\right\} + \vec{1 0 0}.</me>

    <p>In the above <xref ref="solnsets-eg-plane2"/>, the solution set was all vectors of the form

        If <m>Ax=b</m> is consistent,  the set of solutions to is obtained by taking one <term>particular solution</term> <m>p</m> of <m>Ax=b</m>, and adding all solutions of <m>Ax=0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>In particular, if <m>Ax=b</m> is consistent, the solution set is a <em>translate of a span</em>.</p>

      <idx><h>Parametric vector form</h><h>of an inhomogeneous equation</h></idx>
      The <term>parametric vector form</term> of the solutions of <m>Ax=b</m> is just the parametric vector form of the solutions of <m>Ax=0</m>, plus a particular solution <m>p</m>.
    </p>

    <p>It is not hard to see why the <xref ref="solnsets-translate-span"/> is true.  If <m>p</m> is a particular solution, then <m>Ap=b</m>, and if <m>x</m> is a solution to the homogeneous equation <m>Ax=0</m>, then
    <me>A(x+p) = Ax + Ap = 0 + b = b,</me>
    so <m>x+p</m> is another solution of <m>Ax=b</m>.  On the other hand, if we start with any solution <m>x</m> to <m>Ax=b</m> then <m>x-p</m> is a solution to <m>Ax=0</m> since <me>A(x-p)=Ax-Ap=b-b=0</me>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>Row reducing to find the parametric vector form will give you one particular solution <m>p</m> of <m>Ax=b</m>.  But the <xref ref="solnsets-translate-span"/> is true for any solution <m>p</m>.  In other words, if we row reduce in a different way and find a different solution <m>p'</m> to <m>Ax=b</m> then the solutions to <m>Ax=b</m> can be obtained from the solutions to <m>Ax=0</m> by either adding <m>p</m> or by adding <m>p'</m>.</p>
